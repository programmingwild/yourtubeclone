Introduction

The YourTube Clone is a React.js-based video streaming platform inspired by YouTube. The goal of this project was to build a functional video-sharing application that allows users to browse, watch, and interact with videos. The platform also integrates video downloads, comments, private room chats, and a subscription model for premium features.

This project was developed using React.js, Redux, React Router, React Player, WebSockets, and Razorpay for payments.

Background

The motivation behind this project was to gain hands-on experience in building a full-fledged video streaming platform while implementing modern web development concepts like:

State management (Redux)
Component-based UI development (React)
Routing and navigation (React Router)
Video playback and controls (React Player)
Real-time messaging (WebSockets)
Payment integration (Razorpay)
Additionally, the project focused on performance optimization, user experience, and security to ensure a smooth and engaging platform for users.

Learning Objectives

By working on this project, the key learning objectives were:
✔ Understanding React.js and Redux for state management.
✔ Implementing video playback features using React Player.
✔ Building an interactive UI with smooth animations.
✔ Using WebSockets for real-time private chat rooms.
✔ Integrating a payment gateway (Razorpay) for premium features.
✔ Deploying the application on GitHub and Netlify.
✔ Managing a project using Git and version control.

Activities and Tasks

The development of YourTube involved several major tasks:

✅ Project Setup – Initialized the React.js project, installed dependencies, and set up Redux.

✅ Video Grid & Video Player – Implemented a dynamic video grid that displays videos and a fully functional video player.

✅ Search and Sidebar – Created a search bar for real-time video filtering and a sidebar for navigation.

✅ Comments Section – Developed an interactive comments system for user engagement.

✅ Private Room Chat – Implemented end-to-end encrypted real-time private chat rooms.

✅ Video Download Feature – Enabled users to download one video per day for free and integrated Razorpay for premium downloads.

✅ UI Enhancements – Added gesture-based controls, hover effects, and smooth transitions.

✅ Deployment – Uploaded the project to GitHub and deployed it on Netlify.
